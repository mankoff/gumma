Us Mobile Menubar App

[[./screenshot.png]]

* Purpose

If you use [[http://gousmobile.com][US Mobile]] phone service, this app sits in your OS X Menubar and tells you the following:
  + Date your billing cycle ends
  + Percentage of billing cycle remaining
  + Days remaining in billing cycle
  + Minutes remaining
  + Percent of minutes remaining
  + SMS remaining
  + Percentage of SMS remaining
  + Data (MB) remaining
  + Percentage of data (MB) remaining

The icon turns orange if any of remaining usage falls below 10%.

It also provides a link for easy access to top up your account.

* To Do

Usage Notification should be improved. For example:
  + Use the OS X Notification Center
  + Warn if usage % less than days remaining %
    + Currently, the 10% warning will likely trigger at the end of the billing cycle, even if it does not need to.
