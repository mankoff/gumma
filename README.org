* Purpose

If you use [[http://gousmobile.com][US Mobile]] phone service, this app sits in your OS X Menubar and tells:
  + How many minutes you have used this month
  + What percentage of your minutes you have used
  + How many SMS you have used this month
  + What percentage of your SMS you have used
  + How much data you have used this month
  + What percentage of your data you have used
  + What percentage of your billing cycle remains
  + How many days remain in your billing cycle
  + When your billing cycle ends

It turns orange if any of remaining usage falls below 10%.

It provides easy access to topping up your account.

* TODO

  Usage Notification should be improved. For example:
  + Use the OS X Notification Center
  + Warn if usage % < days remaining %
    + Currently, the 10% warning will likely trigger at the end of the billing cycle, even if it does no need to.
