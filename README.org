* Purpose

If you use [[http://gousmobile.com][US Mobile]] phone service, this app sits in your OS X Menubar and graphically shows you the percentage remaining of billing cycle, minutes, SMS, and data. 

The icon turns orange if the percent remaining of a resource falls below the percent remaining of your billing cycle.

This lets you quickly see if you are using more resources than you purchased.

In addition, it tells you:

  + Date your billing cycle ends
  + Days remaining in billing cycle
  + Minutes remaining
  + SMS remaining
  + Data (MB) remaining

It also provides a link for easy access to top up your account.

* To Do

Usage Notification should be improved. For example:
  + Package and release as an App
  + Make use of the OS X Notification Center
  + Don't rely on the deprecated Google Charts API
  + Customize the warning algorithm
  + Other ideas? Submit an [[https://github.com/mankoff/umma/issues][issue]]: https://github.com/mankoff/umma/issues
      
* A Note on Security

This app requests the username and password used to log into the [[http://gousmobile.com][US Mobile Website]]. The username is stored in plain text on your computer. The password is stored in the OS X System Keychain.
